# Transitions

The global presentation transition is set using the `transition` config value. You can override the global transition for a specific slide by using the `data-transition` attribute:

```html
<section data-transition="zoom">
  <h2>This slide will override the presentation transition and zoom!</h2>
</section>

<section data-transition-speed="fast">
  <h2>Choose from three transition speeds: default, fast or slow!</h2>
</section>
```

You can also use different in and out transitions for the same slide:

```html
<section data-transition="slide">
    The train goes on …
</section>
<section data-transition="slide">
    and on …
</section>
<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out">
    and stops.
</section>
<section data-transition="fade-in slide-out">
    (Passengers entering and leaving)
</section>
<section data-transition="slide">
    And it starts again.
</section>
```
You can choose from `none`, `fade`, `slide`, `convex`, `concave` and `zoom`.
