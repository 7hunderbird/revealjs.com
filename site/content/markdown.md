# Markdown

It's possible to write your slides using Markdown. To enable Markdown, add the `data-markdown` attribute to your `<section>` elements and wrap the contents in a `<textarea data-template>` like the example below. You'll also need to add the `plugin/markdown/marked.js` and `plugin/markdown/markdown.js` scripts (in that order) to your HTML file. _Note: both these dependencies are already included in the default `index.html`._

This is based on [data-markdown](https://gist.github.com/1343518) from [Paul Irish](https://github.com/paulirish) modified to use [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) to support [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown). Sensitive to indentation (avoid mixing tabs and spaces) and line breaks (avoid consecutive breaks).

```html
<section data-markdown>
  <textarea data-template>
    ## Page title

    A paragraph with some text and a [link](http://hakim.se).
  </textarea>
</section>
```

## External Markdown

You can write your content as a separate file and have reveal.js load it at runtime. Note the separator arguments which determine how slides are delimited in the external file: the `data-separator` attribute defines a regular expression for horizontal slides (defaults to `^\r?\n---\r?\n$`, a newline-bounded horizontal rule)  and `data-separator-vertical` defines vertical slides (disabled by default). The `data-separator-notes` attribute is a regular expression for specifying the beginning of the current slide's speaker notes (defaults to `notes?:`, so it will match both "note:" and "notes:"). The `data-charset` attribute is optional and specifies which charset to use when loading the external file.

When used locally, this feature requires that reveal.js [runs from a local web server](#full-setup).  The following example customises all available options:

```html
<section data-markdown="example.md"
         data-separator="^\n\n\n"
         data-separator-vertical="^\n\n"
         data-separator-notes="^Note:"
         data-charset="iso-8859-15">
    <!--
        Note that Windows uses `\r\n` instead of `\n` as its linefeed character.
        For a regex that supports all operating systems, use `\r?\n` instead of `\n`.
    -->
</section>
```

## Element Attributes

Special syntax (through HTML comments) is available for adding attributes to Markdown elements. This is useful for fragments, amongst other things.

```html
<section data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
    - Item 1 <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
    - Item 2 <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  </script>
</section>
```

## Slide Attributes

Special syntax (through HTML comments) is available for adding attributes to the slide `<section>` elements generated by your Markdown.

```html
<section data-markdown>
  <script type="text/template">
  <!-- .slide: data-background="#ff0000" -->
    Markdown content
  </script>
</section>
```

## Configuring *marked*

We use [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) to parse Markdown. To customise marked's rendering, you can pass in options when [configuring Reveal](#configuration):

```javascript
Reveal.initialize({
  // Options which are passed into marked
  // See https://marked.js.org/#/USING_ADVANCED.md#options
  markdown: {
    smartypants: true
  }
});
```
