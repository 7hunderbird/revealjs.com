# Getting Started

A framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML. [Check out the live demo](https://revealjs.com/).

reveal.js comes with a broad range of features including [nested slides](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markup), [Markdown support](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#markdown), [PDF export](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export), [speaker notes](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#speaker-notes) and a [JavaScript API](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#api). There's also a fully featured visual editor and platform for sharing reveal.js presentations at [slides.com](https://slides.com?ref=github).

## Supporting reveal.js
This project was started and is maintained by [@hakimel](https://github.com/hakimel/) with the help of many [contributions from the community](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/graphs/contributors). The best way to support the project is to [become a paying member of Slides.com](https://slides.com/pricing)—the reveal.js presentation platform that Hakim is building.

## Online Editor

Presentations are written using HTML or Markdown but there's also an online editor for those of you who prefer a graphical interface. Give it a try at [https://slides.com](https://slides.com?ref=github).
